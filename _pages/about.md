I am Mike Xiangyu LIU. I am currently with [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/), as an Research Assistant. My research focus on Robotic Perception and Navigation, especially for Multi Robot System, with limited computation and communication resources. Bringing robotic systems in more diversed, interesting and challenging application scenarios is my preference of research.

I got my Master degree in Computer Control and Automation in [NTU Singapore](www.ntu.edu.sg), an amazing university in an amazing city. Before that, I graduated from [UESTC](www.uestc.edu.cn) with double bachelor degrees in Electronic Commerce and Electronic Engineering, where, with my excellent team, I won national championship in [Chinese national university robotic challenage](www.robomaster.com), and national first place in national university contest of [Electronic Design](http://www.nuedc-training.com.cn/). Now I am developping interesting robotic systems with [the CVG group](http://www.zjucvg.net/) in ZJU, particularly for multi robot dense mapping and navigation, related publication and presentation is coming very soon.

I take the RA work as a part of the preparation for PhD application, and a compensation for my study plan severely influenced by COVID. And I am always looking for places where I can build the most fascinating robots with the most excellent partners.
